# S3 bucket scanner

Simple public s3 bucket scanner written in python


### How it works

This is a PoC of a public s3 bucket scanner. It uses wordlist to test for existence of publicly open s3 buckets and lists their contents. Wordlist provided with it is just a PoC wordlist I've gathered from various subdomain enumeration lists.



### Requirements 

The only requirements for this to run is python's requests lib . 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
